### Approach

- Initialise switch and state vars
- Iterated through the bulbs and if its state was same as currentstate incremented switches and changed state
- atlast returned switches

### Code

```py
class Solution:
	# @param A : list of integers
	# @return an integer
	def bulbs(self, A):
        switches = 0
        currentState = 0
        for n in A:
            if n == currentState:
                switches += 1
                currentState = 1 - currentState
        return switches
```
