### Approach

- This solution counts the number of times a factorial is divisible by 5, which determines the number of trailing zeroes since there are always more factors of 2 than 5 in any factorial.

### Code

```py
class Solution:
    # @param A : integer
    # @return an integer
    def trailingZeroes(self, A):
        res = 0
        while A:
            res += A//5
            A //= 5
        return res
```
