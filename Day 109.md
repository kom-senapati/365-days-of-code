### Approach

- Created a dp array temp and set its last value to 1 (posisble to break '') and iterated the string
- Checked if the substr was in B and if it was possible to break string from starting j+1
- Atlast returned temp[0]

### Code

```py
class Solution:
    # @param A : string
    # @param B : list of strings
    # @return an integer
    def wordBreak(self, A, B):
        n = len(A)
        temp = [0] * (n + 1)
        temp[n] = 1
        
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            for j in range(i, n):
                if A[i:j+1] in B and temp[j + 1]:
                    temp[i] = 1
                    break
        
        return temp[0]
```
