### Approach

- Fixed the issues in code for desired output.

### Code

```py
from functools import reduce 
def main():
    
    # Use map to print the square of each numbers 
    my_ints = [4, 6, 3, 9, 2, 8, 12]
    
    # Use filter to print only the names that are less than or equal to seven letters
    my_names = ["scaler", "interviewbit", "rishabh", "student", "course"]
    
    # Use reduce to print the product of these numbers
    my_numbers = [4, 6, 9, 23, 5]
    
    # Fix all three respectively. 
    map_result = list(map(lambda x: x**2, my_ints))
    filter_result = list(filter(lambda name: len(name)<=7, my_names))
    reduce_result = reduce(lambda num1, num2: num1 * num2, my_numbers, 1)
    
    print(map_result)
    print(filter_result)
    print(reduce_result)
    return 0

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
