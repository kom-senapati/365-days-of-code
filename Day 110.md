### Approach

- Created a min heap to store rope lengths
- While there were 2 ropes popped two shortest lengths and then merged them and added to res and pushed to min heap
- atlast returned res

### Code

```cpp
int Solution::solve(vector<int> &A) {
    int res = 0;  
    priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> p(A.begin(),A.end());
   
    while (p.size() >= 2) {
        int temp1 = p.top();
        p.pop();
        int temp2 = p.top();
        
        res +=  temp1 + temp2;
        
        p.pop();
        p.push(temp1+temp2);
    }
   
    return res;     
}
```
