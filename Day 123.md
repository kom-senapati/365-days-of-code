### Approach

- created start and end variables
- used two pointers and updated them if diff was not equal to k and if eq and both pointers different and if pointers different returned 1
- atlast returned 0

### Code

```py
class Solution:
    # @param A : list of integers
    # @param B : integer
    # @return an integer
    def diffPossible(self, A, B):
        start, end = 0, 1
        while start < len(A) and end < len(A):
            diff = A[end] - A[start]
            if diff < B:
                end += 1
            elif diff > B:
                start += 1
            elif start != end:
                return 1
            else:
                end += 1
        return 0
```
