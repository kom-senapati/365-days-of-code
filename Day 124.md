### Approach

- Created a frequency dict, iterated over the array and returned 1 if other elements diff with current is B else incremented its count
- Returned 0 if not returned earlier

### Code

```py
class Solution:
    # @param A : tuple of integers
    # @param B : integer
    # @return an integer
    def diffPossible(self, A, B):
        f = {}
        for n in A:
            if (B+n) in f or (n-B) in f:
                return 1
            else:
                f[n] = f.get(n,0)+1
        return 0
```
